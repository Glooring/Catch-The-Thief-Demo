## How to Play

- **Objective:** Block all possible moves of the thief by positioning police officers on the connected node graph.
- **Turn-based Gameplay:** Each turn, the player moves one police officer. After each move, the thief automatically moves to an adjacent, unoccupied node.
- **Thief's Movement:** The thief moves randomly to a connected node after the player's turn.
- **Current State:** There is currently no implemented win condition; the game continues with the thief making random available movements. Future updates will include the win state logic.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity 2023.x**: Built using Unity for 2D game development.
- **WebGL**: The game is deployed as a WebGL build for web-based gameplay.
- **Vercel**: Used for hosting the demo online.
